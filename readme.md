### Introduction  
The Home Depot Kaggle Challenge is a task of ranking products sold by Home Depot in order of relevance to the user search queries. 
The goal of is to develop a model which can accurately rank the products using Learning to Rank algorithms and provide critical
analysis with optimization of models by tuning the hyper-parameters and feature engineering.  

### Project tasks breakdown 
- Literature review.  
- Combining the input data from various files.  
- Pre-processing and cleaning of the data.  
- Feature engineering and selection.  
- Implement Learning to Rank Models from RankLib.  
- Implement Tree based methods as a comparison for RankLib methods.  
- Optimization of various implemented methods.  
- Ensemble Tree based methods.
